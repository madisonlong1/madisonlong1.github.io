# AI Coding Instructions for madisonlong1.github.io

## Project Overview
This is a GitHub Pages repository for CS291 Scalable Internet Services at UCSB. The repository serves as a personal website/portfolio that will be accessible at `https://madisonlong1.github.io`.

## Development Context
- **Repository Type**: GitHub Pages site (automatically deploys from `main` branch)
- **Course Context**: CS291 Scalable Internet Services - focus on web development, performance, and scalability
- **Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to `main`

## Key Conventions & Patterns

### File Structure
- Root `index.html` serves as the main landing page
- Static assets should be organized in dedicated folders (`css/`, `js/`, `images/`)
- Course-related content should be clearly organized (projects, assignments, blog posts)

### GitHub Pages Specifics
- Site builds automatically from `main` branch
- Jekyll is supported by default (can use `_config.yml` for Jekyll sites)
- Custom domains can be configured via `CNAME` file
- Relative paths preferred for cross-page navigation

### Academic/Portfolio Focus
- Include sections for course projects, assignments, and reflections
- Maintain professional presentation suitable for academic and career purposes
- Consider performance optimization techniques relevant to CS291 coursework
- Document learning outcomes and technical implementations

## Development Workflow
1. Test changes locally when possible before pushing
2. Use semantic commit messages for course project tracking
3. Consider responsive design for mobile/desktop viewing
4. Optimize for fast loading (relevant to scalability concepts)

## Technologies to Consider
- **Static Site**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS or Jekyll
- **Frameworks**: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Performance**: Minification, image optimization, CDN usage
- **Analytics**: GitHub Pages supports Google Analytics integration

## Course Integration
- Document CS291 projects with technical details and lessons learned
- Include performance metrics and scalability considerations in project descriptions
- Showcase understanding of web technologies, databases, and distributed systems concepts

When adding content, prioritize clear documentation of technical implementations and learning outcomes that demonstrate CS291 course objectives.
